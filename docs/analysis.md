[Jer 23:4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/23.4?lang=eng#p3) | They comfort, encourage, and build the confidence of God's actual followers (humble, penitent disciples as opposed to proud, self-willed hypocrites).
[Jer 23:4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/23.4?lang=eng#p3), [James 1:27](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/james/1.27?lang=eng#p26) | They take care of temporal needs.

[Jer 23:14](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/23.14?lang=eng#p13) | They commit adultery.
[Jer 23:14](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/23.14?lang=eng#p13) | They walk (live, proceed, go, move) in lies (fraud, betrayal, falsehood).
[Jer 23:14](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/23.14?lang=eng#p13) | They sustain the wicked and don't urge repentance.
