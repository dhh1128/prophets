### false prophets
source | indicator
--- | ---
x | They destroy, scatter, and pillage the flock. This is not the same as prophets who struggle to serve a flock that's being destroyed by others (Peter with the early Christians, Alma with the righteous burned in Ammonihah, Jeremiah with Jerusalem); false prophets actively exploit the flock with the effect that it is destroyed and scattered.
x | They fail to love and visit the flock. They are neglectful and lack empathy.
x | They are profane (defiled, corrupted, polluted).
x | They are gluttonous and lustful. They commit adultery. 
x | They walk (live, proceed, go, move) in lies (fraud, betrayal, falsehood). They make false predictions and teach false principles.
x | They sustain the wicked, tell them what they want to hear, and don't urge repentance.
x | They practice priestcraft. They make a profession out of being a spiritual guide for others.
x | They are contentious.
x | They claim to be love God's ways, but what they actually love is the apparance of godliness in their own traditions. They discourage belief in contemporary miracles and revelation, and in direct godliness.
x | They are hypocrites -- professing piety while actually having no love for God and no intention to live as He would.
x | They are puffed up and proud. They love fancy clothes and ceremonies. They are very concerned with public reputation and appearance.
x | They teach false, vain, foolish, flattering, blasphemous doctrines that turn people aside from repentance, and from loving and righteously serving Christ. They undermine faith. They predict blessings for evil people.

x | They are angry about God's actual truth.
x | They teach with their learning, or their own imagination, or in the name of other gods, rather than the Spirit and the Lord's endorsement.
x | They demand signs, and encourage others to do the same. They love to provide impressive proofs of their cleverness or power.
x | They accuse and persecute God's true servants and scorn legitimate authority.
x | They call themselves (or are called by other corrupt leaders). This is necessarily true, since God would never call them.
x | They are violent.
x | They are idolatrous (worship something other than God).
x | They are lazy.
x | They conspire.
x | They love money and worldly power. They are greedy and covetous.
x | They deny basic and pure doctrines and hammer on esoteric or obscure, marginal topics where they claim to have expertise and others have little knowledge. They take inflexible, demanding positions that require God's followers to bear heavy burdens and to feel confused and despairing at the difficulty of salvation. They strain at a gnat and swallow a camel.
x | They offer to explain things so listeners don't have to follow the Holy Ghost.
x | They are jealous and envious of others' power.
